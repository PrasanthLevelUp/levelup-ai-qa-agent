/**
 * Persistent Scenario Graph — the ONE intelligence source.
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The long-term architecture: a requirement is parsed into a canonical graph of
 * scenarios ONCE, stored, and then REUSED by every module instead of each module
 * re-deriving the same knowledge:
 *
 *        Requirement
 *             │
 *             ▼
 *        Scenario Graph  ── Login Success / Invalid Password / Invalid Email /
 *             │            Empty Fields / Password Masking / SQL Injection /
 *             │            Session Timeout / Remember Me …
 *             ▼
 *        Store once
 *             │
 *             ▼
 *        Reuse everywhere
 *          ├── Test Case Lab        (formats the nodes into test cases)
 *          ├── Script Generation    (turns nodes into automation specs)
 *          ├── Healing              (maps a broken selector back to its nodes)
 *          ├── RTM                  (requirement → scenario traceability rows)
 *          └── Impact Analysis      (a changed selector/page → impacted nodes)
 *
 *      AI only POLISHES wording or FILLS gaps — it is never the source of truth.
 *
 * This module defines the canonical, serialisable domain model. It is pure data
 * + tiny pure helpers: no I/O, no LLM, no framework types. The builder
 * (scenario-graph-builder.ts) produces it deterministically from the existing
 * planner → builder → validator pipeline; the service (scenario-graph-service.ts)
 * persists and reuses it; the adapters (scenario-graph-adapters.ts) project it
 * into the exact shape each consuming module needs.

 * grounding provenance). Modules take a PROJECTION of this — none of them
 * re-derive it.
 *
 * INVARIANT — every field here must serve at least TWO downstream consumers.
 * The graph is the canonical contract, not a junk drawer: a field used by only
 * one module belongs in that module, not on the shared node. This keeps the

 * CONTRACT — this node's shape is FROZEN. It is organised into seven ownership
 * sections (identity / semantics / resources / execution / actions / assertions
 * / metadata) with strict placement rules. Before adding, moving, or repurposing
 * any field, read docs/EXECUTION_GRAPH_CONTRACT.md and bump
 * SCENARIO_GRAPH_SCHEMA_VERSION. Three-question separation to keep straight:
 * `semantics` = what the scenario MEANS; `resources` = what it NEEDS (immutable
 * requirement, e.g. a data ROLE, browser, locale); `execution` = what THIS run
 * actually USED (the resolved dataset/browser/locale). So `requiredDataRole` is
 * a ROLE requirement (belongs in `semantics` today, `resources.dataRoles` once
 * that section lands); a RESOLVED dataset record belongs in `execution`, never
 * in `semantics` or `resources`. The reserved `resources`, `actions[]` (Sprint

## 0. Purpose

The scenario pipeline is done. Phases A/B (Scenario Data Model + Renderers — PR #247) gave us a
single canonical scenario, projected per consumer. We are **not** going to keep redesigning the
pipeline.

From here, we make the **existing Script Composer progressively smarter** through deterministic
engineering heuristics, ranking algorithms, and quality refinements — never through new
orchestrators, intelligence providers, writers, planners, or pipelines.

This document freezes the architecture at **v1.0** and defines the incremental roadmap
(Sprints 1, 1.5, 2–7 + the two deterministic rule libraries) that raises generated-code quality without
destabilizing the foundation.

---

## 1. The Freeze Mandate (read this first)

> **Freeze the architecture. Do not introduce new orchestrators, intelligence providers, writers,
> planners, or pipelines. All future improvements must occur inside the existing Script Composer
> through deterministic engineering heuristics, ranking algorithms, and quality refinements. Every
> PR must make the generated framework look more like code written by an experienced automation
> engineer while preserving existing capabilities and avoiding regressions.**

### The single measure of success

Every future PR is judged by one question:

> **"Would a senior Playwright engineer approve this pull request without realizing it was
> AI-generated?"**

If a change does not move us toward **yes**, it does not belong in this roadmap.

### What this explicitly forbids

- ❌ New orchestrators / intelligence providers / writers / planners / pipelines
- ❌ Moving responsibilities between frozen components (see §2)
- ❌ More comments, AI explaining every action, verbose logging
- ❌ Huge helper methods, generated documentation, over-engineering
- ❌ Defaulting to the LLM when a deterministic heuristic can decide

### What this encourages

- ✅ Better **decisions** inside existing engines (ranking, scoring, fallback)
- ✅ Deterministic heuristics over prompts (no token growth)
- ✅ Reuse of existing framework assets over regeneration
- ✅ Honest confidence signals over pretended certainty

---

## 2. The Frozen Pipeline (v1.0)

These are foundation components. **Freeze them. Do not keep moving responsibilities around.**

```
Requirement
    ↓
Scenario Builder          (engines/scenario-builder.ts — canonical scenario, Phase A)
    ↓
Scenario Integrity Engine (certifies the scenario; warnings only, never mutates — Sprint 1.5)
    ↓
Canonical Scenario        (grounding[] + structured expected, one source of truth)
    ↓
Execution Context         (crawl + repo intelligence + app profile + conventions)
    ↓
Script Composer           (script-gen/script-gen-engine.ts — ScriptGenEngine)
    ↓
Quality Gate              (validation-runner + ai-review-engine + framework-auditor)
    ↓
Persist                   (generated_test_cases / scripts + ai_metadata)
```

> The **Scenario Integrity Engine** is a deterministic certifier inserted between the Scenario
> Builder and everything downstream. It does **not** own or mutate scenario data — the Scenario
> Builder remains the sole owner. It only answers: *"Is this canonical scenario internally
> consistent and automation-ready?"* and attaches a readiness score + warnings. See Sprint 1.5.

### Where each frozen stage lives in the codebase

| Stage | Primary module(s) |
| --- | --- |
| Scenario Builder | `src/engines/scenario-builder.ts` |
| **Scenario Integrity Engine** | `src/engines/scenario-integrity/` *(proposed — Sprint 1.5)* |
| Canonical Scenario | `DraftTestCase` / `FormatterTestCase` (`grounding[]`, structured `expected`, `schemaVersion`) |
| Renderers / Projection | `src/renderers/scenario-renderer.ts` (Manual / Script / BDD) |
| Execution Context | `src/script-gen/page-crawler.ts`, `src/context/*`, `src/intelligence/project-convention-profile.ts` |
| **Script Composer** | `src/script-gen/script-gen-engine.ts` (`ScriptGenEngine`) |
| Quality Gate | `src/script-gen/validation-runner.ts`, `ai-review-engine.ts`, `framework-auditor.ts` |
| Persist | `src/api/routes/script-gen.ts`, `test-coverage.ts` |

Everything in the roadmap below happens **inside the Script Composer** and its owned sub-engines.
No stage boundary moves.

---

## 3. Evolve the Script Composer — not the pipeline

The Script Composer (`ScriptGenEngine`) already composes the sub-engines we will sharpen. We are
**not** adding engines; we are making the existing ones decide better.

| Sub-engine (exists today) | Role | Sprint that sharpens it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SelectorQualityEngine` + `intelligence/element-intelligence.rankLocatorCandidates` | Locator scoring | **Sprint 2** |
| `AssertionEngine` | Assertions | **Sprints 3 & 4** |
| `project-convention-profile` (`buildReuseCatalogue`, `findReusablePageObject`) | Reuse | **Sprint 5** |
| `ai-review-engine` / `framework-auditor` | Style / audit | **Sprint 6** |
| `engines/confidence-engine.ts` | Confidence | **Sprint 7** |
| `core/candidate-ranker.ts` + `core/advisors/*` | Ranking (healing side) | **Reuse target for Sprint 2** |

> **Reuse-first note:** the healing side already has a mature scored candidate ranker
> (`core/candidate-ranker.ts` with `SOURCE_TRUST`, plus `core/advisors/{rule-engine,app-profile,
> dom-candidate,dom-memory,learned-pattern,ai}-advisor.ts`). Sprint 2 should **reuse and extend**
> this ranking substrate for generation, not build a parallel one. One ranking brain, two callers.

---

## 4. Roadmap

### Sprint 1 — Fix & Freeze  ✅ (this PR set)

- ✅ Fix the **Generate Script** regression (Test Case Lab → Script Gen deep link now selects the
  requirement, prefills the scenario, and hides/omits App Knowledge because the test case is ready).
  *(dashboard PR #146)*
- ✅ Merge PR #247 (Scenario Data Model + Renderers). *(owner action)*
- ✅ Create this document (`SCRIPT_COMPOSER_EVOLUTION.md`) and **declare the architecture frozen.**
- **No new intelligence.**

---

### Sprint 1.5 — Scenario Integrity Engine  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (do before Sprint 2)

A deterministic **certifier** that sits between the Scenario Builder and the Script Composer. It is
**not new intelligence** — no LLM, no generation. It answers one question:

> **"Is this canonical scenario internally consistent and automation-ready?"**

Today the Script Composer sometimes *compensates* for weak test cases. It shouldn't have to. If the
Composer always receives a high-quality, certified scenario, locator / assertion / coverage mistakes
drop **without touching generation.** This is the first of the two deterministic rule libraries (see
§5) and the natural partner to the Engineering Heuristics Library.

#### Hard rule: report, never rewrite

```
Scenario → Validator → Issues → (same) Scenario     ✅
Scenario → Validator → Scenario rewritten           ❌  (forbidden)
```

The Scenario Builder remains the **sole owner** of scenario data. The Integrity Engine only attaches
quality signals (warnings + a readiness score); it never mutates steps, grounding, or expected.

#### What it validates

1. **Persona consistency** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — the persona/test data must match the scenario intent.
   - `Title: Login with locked user` + `Test Data: standard_user` → **fail**
   - `Title: Successful login` + `Expected: Authentication rejected` → **fail**
2. **Coverage polarity** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — expected outcome must match the coverage type (deterministic):
   - positive → success state (e.g. dashboard displayed)
   - negative → error shown
   - edge → graceful validation
   - boundary → limit accepted/rejected
3. **Test-data suitability** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — dataset must fit the scenario.
   - `valid login` scenario + `locked_user` dataset → **fail**
4. **Expected-result consistency** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — manual outcome vs. structured expected must agree.
   - manual `Login successful` + expected `Error displayed` → **fail**
5. **Step completeness** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — steps must plausibly produce the expected outcome.
   - `Click Login` → expected `Inventory page`, but no username/password entered → **incomplete, flag**
6. **Missing preconditions** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — required preconditions must be present.
   - `Checkout` without `User logged in` → **flag**
7. **Grounding completeness** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ — every actionable step should have grounding.
   - `Enter username` with no grounding → **do not fail; reduce confidence.**

#### Automation Readiness Score

Before the Script Composer starts, the engine computes a scenario-quality score so the Composer knows
**how much to trust the scenario:**

| Check | Result |
| --- | :--: |
| Persona | ✅ |
| Expected | ✅ |
| Preconditions | ✅ |
| Grounding | ⚠️ |
| Test Data | ✅ |
| Coverage | ✅ |

```
Scenario Ready — 96%
```

The score (and the per-check breakdown) is carried alongside the scenario and later feeds the Sprint 7
Confidence Engine and Smart TODOs — honest signal instead of silent compensation.

#### Where it lives

`src/engines/scenario-integrity/` — a pure, dependency-light rule module. Output is a typed
`ScenarioIntegrityReport { readinessScore, checks[], warnings[] }` attached to the scenario. No stage
boundary moves; the Scenario Builder still owns the data.

**Milestones (ship small — measure after each):**
- **1.5a** — Report scaffold + persona / expected-result / coverage-polarity checks (the three highest-signal, purely-textual checks).
- **1.5b** — Test-data suitability + missing-preconditions + step-completeness checks.
- **1.5c** — Grounding-completeness check (confidence penalty, not a failure).
- **1.5d** — Automation Readiness Score aggregation + surface the report to the Script Composer and dashboard.

> **Sequencing:** only after the Scenario Integrity Engine is stable do we begin Sprint 2.

---

### Sprint 2 — Locator Ranking Engine  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (highest ROI)

This is **not** "better locators." It is **better locator decision-making.**

**Today**

```
Grounding → Selector
```

**Target**

```
Grounding → Candidate Discovery → Candidate Ranking → Candidate Selection → Confidence
```

#### 4.1 Candidate Discovery — collect, do not select

Gather candidates from every source, in priority order. **Do not choose yet.**

1. Existing **Page Object** methods (reuse wins)
2. **App Profile** (crawled grounding)
3. **Test Case** wording
4. **Expected Result** text
5. **Requirement** text
6. **DOM** relationships
7. **Accessibility** (role + name, aria-label, label association)
8. **AI** — last resort only

> **Fallback search chain before AI.** When the App Profile misses an element, do **not** jump to
> the LLM. Search deterministically first:
> ```
> Test Case → Keywords → Expected Result → Requirement → Page Object → DOM → AI
> ```
> Example — manual step `Click Login`, expected `Dashboard appears`: the composer infers Login
> causes navigation and searches for `login / sign in / submit / authenticate` candidates instead
> of hallucinating a selector.

#### 4.2 Candidate Ranking — score every candidate

Reuse/extend `core/candidate-ranker.ts` scoring. Indicative scores:

| Source / strategy | Score |
| --- | --: |
| Existing Page Object method | 100 |
| `data-testid` | 98 |
| `role` + accessible name | 96 |
| `aria-label` | 95 |
| label association | 94 |
| placeholder | 88 |
| stable CSS | 82 |
| DOM fingerprint | 78 |
| XPath | 40 |

**Never just use the first locator. Find → Rank → Choose.**

#### 4.3 Candidate Selection

- Choose the highest-scoring candidate.
- If the top two are close, keep **both** — record the runner-up as an alternative:
  ```
  Chosen:      getByRole('button', { name: 'Login' })
  Alternative: getByTestId('login-btn')
  ```

#### 4.4 Confidence banding (feeds Sprint 7)

| Confidence | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **> 90** | Generate normally. |
| **70–90** | Generate normally **and** record `Review recommended.` |
| **< 70** | Generate a `TODO` with a reason (e.g. *Dynamic element*) and a suggested locator. |

**Milestones (ship small — measure after each):**
- **2a** — Candidate Discovery: collect candidates from all sources into a typed list (no behavior change to selection yet).
- **2b** — Ranking: score candidates via the shared ranker; log chosen vs. alternatives.
- **2c** — Selection + alternative retention.
- **2d** — Confidence banding + TODO emission for `< 70`.

---

### Sprint 3 — Assertion Expansion  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Automation should validate **more** than the manual test, because it can. Deterministic expansion
inside `AssertionEngine` — **not** prompting.

**Input** `Verify login successful` → **Output**

```
✓ URL changed
✓ Dashboard visible
✓ Logout button visible
✓ Session established
✓ No error present
✓ Inventory / landing content loaded
```

Rules: verify the **business outcome first**, then add one or two **stability** assertions. Never
generate redundant assertions.

---

### Sprint 4 — Coverage Expansion  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Different from Sprint 3. Not more assertions — **more business coverage.**

**Manual** `Add item to cart` → **Automation additionally verifies**

- cart badge updated
- item count
- total price
- persistence (survives reload / navigation)
- navigation correctness

Meaningful, business-relevant checks only — never random assertions. Automation coverage should
**always exceed** the manual test case.

---

### Sprint 5 — Framework Reuse  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Improve **reuse**, not generation. Aggressively consult
`project-convention-profile` (`buildReuseCatalogue`, `findReusablePageObject`) and repo pattern
analysis.

```
login() ; login() ; login()     →     authenticatedFixture()
```

If `login()` (or any page-object method / fixture / helper) already exists, **reuse it — never
regenerate.** The less code we generate, the more senior it looks.

---

### Sprint 6 — Humanization  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

The framework must not *feel* generated. The problem is rarely correctness — it is that the output
is **too symmetrical.** Senior engineers extract methods, simplify, and drop noise.

Reduce, inside `ai-review-engine` / `framework-auditor`:

- repetition
- unnecessary comments
- unnecessary variables
- over-defensive code
- identical naming everywhere

Make it feel like a teammate wrote it — following project conventions.

---

### Sprint 7 — Confidence Engine  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Last. Do not rewrite. Do not regenerate.** Simply identify uncertainty and be honest about it,
building on `engines/confidence-engine.ts` and the Sprint 2 bands.

Before returning, the composer asks: **"Would I merge this PR?"** — checking locator, assertion,
reuse, compile, and framework confidence. When confidence is low, **flag**, don't guess.

#### Smart TODOs (not AI noise)

Emit TODOs **only** when confidence is genuinely low — never a wall of `TODO TODO TODO`.

```ts
// Review locator:
// Dynamic element detected after login.
// Suggested locator:
// page.getByRole('button', { name: /checkout/i })
```

---

## 5. The two deterministic rule libraries (the secret sauce)

The system will have **exactly two** deterministic rule libraries — and no third intelligence layer.
They complement each other without adding an AI component or growing prompts:

| Library | Question it answers | Stage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scenario Integrity Engine** (§4, Sprint 1.5) | *"Is the canonical scenario internally correct and automation-ready?"* | Before the Composer |
| **Engineering Heuristics Library** (below) | *"Given a correct scenario, what is the best way to implement it as production-quality automation?"* | Inside the Composer |

Together they give a stronger long-term foundation than continually expanding prompts or adding new
AI components: one certifies the **input**, the other governs the **implementation** — both
deterministic, both token-free, both versioned and unit-tested.

### 5.1 Engineering Heuristics Library

Not another intelligence. A **deterministic rule library** that captures how experienced automation
engineers think. Every generation consults it. **No LLM. No prompt. No tokens.** It improves the
product over time without growing prompt size.

**Proposed home:** `src/script-gen/heuristics/` (a pure, dependency-light rule module consumed by
`ScriptGenEngine`). Rules are data + pure functions — unit-tested and versioned.

### Rule families

**Locator heuristics**
- Prefer existing page-object methods.
- Prefer `data-testid`.
- Prefer accessible roles and names.
- Avoid brittle CSS / XPath unless necessary.

**Assertion heuristics**
- Verify business outcome first.
- Add one or two stability assertions.
- Don't generate redundant assertions.

**Framework heuristics**
- Reuse existing fixtures.
- Reuse page-object methods.
- Don't create duplicate utilities.

**Naming heuristics**
- Follow the project's existing naming conventions.
- Avoid identical/templated names everywhere.

**Playwright heuristics**
- No `waitForTimeout`; use web-first assertions and auto-waiting.
- Prefer user-facing locators (`getByRole` / `getByLabel`).

These heuristics evolve over time (Sprint 7+ "continuous learning" improves the weights from
successful generations) — **without** increasing token usage or architectural complexity.

---

## 6. Long-term stable roadmap

| Phase | Goal | Change type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Fix & Freeze | Regression fix + freeze declaration |
| **1.5** | **Scenario Integrity Engine** | **Certify the scenario (readiness score + warnings); never mutate** |
| 2 | Locator Ranking Engine | Improve **selection**, no architecture changes |
| 3 | Assertion Expansion | Increase automation coverage |
| 4 | Coverage Expansion | Add meaningful automation-only validations |
| 5 | Framework Reuse | Reduce duplication |
| 6 | Human-like Code Style | Output indistinguishable from hand-written code |
| 7 | Confidence Engine | Flag uncertain areas instead of guessing |
| (ongoing) | Continuous Learning | Improve heuristic weights from successful generations |

**Notice what is missing:** no new orchestrators, no new intelligence providers, no new pipelines,
no major rewrites.

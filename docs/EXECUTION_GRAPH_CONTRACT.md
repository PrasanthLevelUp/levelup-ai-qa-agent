# The Execution Graph Contract (frozen)

> **Status:** FROZEN as of Sprint 2D. Architecture review complete — the section model is final.
> Remaining work is *populating* the graph, not reshaping it. Changes to the section model below
> require a design review and a schema-version bump — not an ad-hoc field added to a node.
>
> **Scope:** This document freezes the canonical shape of `ScenarioNode` / `ScenarioGraph`
> (`src/graph/scenario-graph.ts`) *before* Sprint 2D adds executable Actions (2D.3) and
> executable Assertions (2D.4). It exists so that six months from now nobody drops
> `resolvedDataset` inside `semantics`, or an assertion inside `metadata`.

## 1. Why this is now called the *Execution Graph*

The type is still named `ScenarioGraph` in code (renaming is deferred to avoid churn), but the
**mental model has changed**. Through Sprint 2C it described *what scenarios exist*. After Sprint 2D
it will describe *exactly how each scenario executes*:

```
Requirement
   ↓
Scenario Graph ──────────────► Execution Graph
   (what scenarios exist)        (how each scenario executes)
                                   • execution data   (2D.2)
                                   • executable actions   (2D.3)
                                   • executable assertions (2D.4)
```

Once complete, it is the **core domain model of LevelUp AI** — the single canonical execution model
consumed by:

```
Script Generation · Healing · Replay · Self-Healing · Impact Analysis · Coverage Gap Analysis
```

Every one of those reads the *same* node. None re-derives it.

---

## 2. The canonical `ScenarioNode` — seven sections

A node is organised into **seven ownership sections**. Every field lives in exactly one section, chosen
by the placement rules in §3. This is the frozen contract:

```ts
ScenarioNode {

  // ── 1. IDENTITY ─────────────────────────────  immutable, defines "which scenario"
  id                 // stable KB scenarioId — the join key for every consumer
  title
  objective

  // ── 2. KNOWLEDGE (semantics) ────────────────  immutable, "what the scenario MEANS"
  semantics {
    variableUnderTest
    preconditions
    variation
    expectedBehavior
    requiredDataRole          // DEPRECATED — a data ROLE ("a registered user"), never a resolved
                              //   dataset. Migrates to resources.dataRoles in Graph Schema 2.0.
                              //   Kept here only until `resources` lands so migration stays additive.
  }

  // ── 3. RESOURCES  (reserved) ────────────────  immutable, "what the scenario NEEDS"
  // REQUIREMENTS ONLY. Resources holds abstract capability requirements, never a
  // resolved/selected value. Right:  registered_user, chromium, staging, inventory_api.
  // Wrong: standard_user, "Chrome 139", "staging-03" — those are resolved values and
  // belong in `execution`. Execution owns the resolved values, forever.
  resources {
    dataRoles                 // e.g. ["registered_user"]  (the role requirement, NOT "standard_user")
    services                  // e.g. ["inventory_api"]     (required backing services / mocks)
    environment               // required env CLASS (e.g. "staging"), NOT a host like "staging-03"
    browser                   // required browser CAPABILITY (e.g. "chromium"), NOT "Chrome 139"
    locale                    // required locale (e.g. "en-US")
    // featureFlags / device / tenant / oauthClient — natural future members
  }

  // ── 4. EXECUTION ────────────────────────────  runtime, "what THIS run actually USED"
  // RUNTIME RESOLVED VALUES ONLY. Execution answers exactly one question:
  // "what did this run actually use?" — nothing more.
  // Allowed:     resolvedDataset, resolvedBrowser, resolvedLocale, resolvedEnvironment.
  // NOT allowed: executionOrder, retryPolicy, priority, coverage — those are not
  //              "what this run used"; they belong in metadata or elsewhere.
  execution {
    resolvedDataset           // 2D.2 — concrete record resolved from resources.dataRoles
    // resolvedBrowser / resolvedLocale / resolvedEnvironment — natural future members
  }

  // ── 5. ACTIONS  (landed in 2D.3) ────────────  immutable, "the executable steps"
  actions[] {
    id                        // stable identity for this step within the node
    order                     // 0-based execution order (array is authoritative)
    action                    // navigate | fill | click | check | uncheck | select | upload
                              //   (STATE-CHANGING verbs ONLY — no `verify`; assertions are §6)
    target                    // CANONICAL element identity (app-neutral semantic key, e.g.
                              //   `username` — NOT `email_input` and NOT a raw locator). The
                              //   Builder copies this VERBATIM; the Execution Resolver in
                              //   Script Gen grounds it to a locator at emit time.
    value?                    // literal, or @dataset.* reference resolved from execution
    optional?                 // step may be skipped when its target is absent
  }

  // ── 6. ASSERTIONS  (added in 2D.4) ──────────  immutable, "the executable expected outcomes"
  assertions[] {
    type                      // url | visible | hidden | text | value | enabled | disabled | count | error
    target                    // stable element identity (when the assertion is element-scoped)
    expected                  // the EXPECTED literal / pattern. Named `expected` (not `value`)
                              //   because assertions compare actual-vs-expected; actions consume
                              //   `value`, assertions verify `expected`.
  }

  // ── 7. QA METADATA + PROVENANCE ─────────────  diagnostic / classification
  coverageType, priority, severity, riskArea, tags,
  automationReady, automationComplexity, selectorAvailability,
  source, sourceEvidence, grounded,
  expectedResults            // human-readable outcomes (superseded for execution by §6)
  dependencies               // typed edges live on the graph; per-node refs here if needed
  metadata                   // confidence, timings, telemetry — never behaviour-bearing
}
```

## 3. Placement rules — what belongs in each section

| Section        | Immutable?      | Answers…                          | Example                         | Do NOT put here |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|
| **identity**   | ✅ immutable    | *Which scenario is this?*         | `id: "auth-neg-wrong-password"` | anything run-varying |
| **semantics**  | ✅ immutable    | *What does it fundamentally mean?*| `variableUnderTest: "password"` | resolved values, locators, requirements |
| **resources**  | ✅ immutable    | *What does it NEED to run?*        | `dataRoles: ["registered_user"]` | resolved/selected values (those are execution) |
| **execution**  | ❌ runtime      | *What did THIS run actually use?* | `resolvedDataset: {username,…}` | anything that changes identity |
| **actions**    | ✅ immutable    | *What steps execute, in order?*   | `{action:"fill", target:"username"}` | resolved values inline (use `@dataset.*`) |
| **assertions** | ✅ immutable    | *What outcomes are verified?*     | `{type:"url", expected:"/inventory"}` | prose like "login succeeds" |
| **metadata**   | ❌ diagnostic   | *How confident / how measured?*   | `confidence: 0.82`              | anything behaviour-bearing |

**The three-question separation** — the reason `resources` and `execution` are distinct sections:

| Question                                   | Section     | Example                        |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| *What does this scenario **mean**?*        | `semantics` | variable under test = password |
| *What does this scenario **need**?*        | `resources` | a registered user, chromium, en-US |
| *What did **this run** actually use?*      | `execution` | standard_user, Chrome 139, en-US |

`resources` is the immutable *requirement* ("I need a registered user"); `execution` is the mutable
*resolution* ("this run used standard_user"). They are different abstractions and must never be merged.
This is exactly why `requiredDataRole` (the need) and `resolvedDataset` (the resolution) cannot share a
section.

### The decision test (apply to every new field)

1. **Does it change if the same scenario runs with a different dataset / env / browser?**
   → YES → is it the *requirement* (immutable need) or the *resolved value* (this run)?
   → requirement → `resources`; resolved value → `execution`. NO → continue.
2. **Is it a value the run produces or measures (never an input)?**
   → YES → `metadata`. NO → continue.
3. **Is it a step the browser performs?** → `actions`.
4. **Is it an outcome the test verifies?** → `assertions`.
5. **Does it define what the scenario *means* independent of any run?** → `semantics`.
6. **Does it identify *which* scenario this is?** → `identity`.

If a field seems to fit two sections, it is probably two fields. Split it. (The canonical example:
`requiredDataRole` / `dataRoles` is a `resources` requirement; the record it resolves to is `execution`.)

### Hard invariants (still enforced)

- **A ROLE requirement is never a resolved dataset.** The data-role requirement (`semantics.requiredDataRole`
  today, `resources.dataRoles` once `resources` lands) is an immutable NEED. The Dataset Resolver maps role
  → record; the resolved record lands in `execution.resolvedDataset`. A resolved record must **never** appear
  in `semantics` or `resources` — requirement and resolution are different abstractions.
- **`target` is a CANONICAL, application-neutral semantic identity — never app vocabulary and never a raw
  locator.** The KB authors canonical targets (`username`), the Builder copies them VERBATIM (it does NOT
  translate `username` → `email_input`), and the **Execution Resolver** in Script Gen grounds canonical →
  app selector → Playwright locator at emit time. This keeps the graph framework- and app-neutral: if the
  app renames a field, only the resolver changes — the graph never regenerates.
- **Actions are STATE-CHANGING verbs ONLY** (`navigate`/`fill`/`click`/`check`/`uncheck`/`select`/`upload`).
  There is deliberately no `verify` action — a scenario's expected outcomes are Assertions (§6), a separate
  concern. Actions *do*; assertions *check*. Mixing them was explicitly rejected.
- **`value` may be a `@dataset.*` reference.** Actions reference execution data symbolically so the same
  action list is reusable across datasets — the value is bound from `execution.resolvedDataset` at emit time.
- **Every shared-node field serves ≥2 consumers.** Single-consumer data belongs in that consumer, not on
  the node. The graph is a contract, not a junk drawer.
- **Identity / semantics / resources / actions / assertions are immutable per scenario.** Only `execution`
  and `metadata` vary run-to-run. The fingerprint hashes identity + semantics + resources + actions +
  assertions — never execution or metadata.

## 4. Schema-version governance

`SCENARIO_GRAPH_SCHEMA_VERSION` (currently `'1.1.0'` — bumped from `1.0.0` when 2D.3 populated `actions`) is
the contract version. Bump it when the shape changes:

- **PATCH** — additive optional field within an existing section, backward-compatible.
- **MINOR** — new section slot populated for the first time (`resources`, 2D.3 `actions`, 2D.4 `assertions`).
- **MAJOR** — a field moves sections, is removed, or changes meaning (requires migration + review).

Persisted graphs record the version they were built with; readers must tolerate older optional-field-absent
graphs (as they already do for `semantics` and `execution`).

---

## 5. Migration state (Sprint 2D)

| Section     | Present in code today | Populated by | First consumer |
|-------------|:---------------------:|--------------|----------------|
| identity    | ✅ | builder | all |
| semantics   | ✅ (optional) | builder ← KB (`getScenarioSemantics`) | Test Case Lab, Script Gen, Healing, Dataset Resolver |
| **resources** | 🔲 reserved (role req. in `semantics.requiredDataRole` today) | builder ← KB | Dataset Resolver (+ future env/browser consumers) |
| execution   | ✅ (optional; `resolvedDataset`) | builder ← Dataset Resolver | Test Case Lab, Script Gen (2D.2) |
| **actions** | ✅ (optional) | builder ← KB (`getScenarioActionTemplate`) | Script Gen (`generateFromTestCase` + `generateFromTestCases`) |
| **assertions** | 🔲 reserved | builder (2D.4) | Script Gen (2D.4) |
| metadata    | ✅ (scattered) | builder / validator | RTM, telemetry |

**The rule for the rest of Sprint 2D:** additions land in the reserved slots above, in the PR that also
adds their consumer. No field is added anywhere else on the node without updating this document and bumping
the schema version.

---

## 6. Definition of "frozen"

The contract is frozen means:

1. The seven sections and their ownership are fixed. New data goes into an existing section per §3, or is
   not a node concern.
2. `resources`, `actions[]` and `assertions[]` have a **known, documented shape** before they are
   implemented — so those PRs populate a pre-agreed slot rather than debating structure mid-sprint.
3. Any deviation is a reviewed schema change, not a silent field.

This is what lets every subsequent sprint be *additive*: the destination for each new capability is already
decided. **No more structural discussions — only fill the reserved sections.**

**The one question every PR from here must answer:**

> **What capability moved into the Execution Graph?**

— *not* — *"what new architecture should we invent?"* The model is complete enough that the remaining work is
**populating** the graph, not reshaping it. Do not redesign the model again unless a real product problem
forces it (which is then a reviewed MAJOR schema change, per §4).

---

**Next step:** Sprint 2D.4 — graph owns executable **assertions** (`assertions[]`: `type` / `target` /
`expected`). (2D.3 — graph owns executable `actions[]`, consumed by Script Gen — is implemented and in
review as PR #274; 2D.2 — consume `execution.resolvedDataset` — merged as PR #273.)
